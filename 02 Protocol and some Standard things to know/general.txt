Data flow

-> Sending an request

	1. Browser parses the URL
	2. Does a DNS Lookup (convert the domain into their IP like google.com to 142.250.192.142)
	3. Now establishes a connection to the IP (does handshake)
	

-> Server handling the request
	
	1. Get the inputs (route, body, header)
	2. Do some logic on the input and calculate the output
	3. Return the output body, headers, status code
