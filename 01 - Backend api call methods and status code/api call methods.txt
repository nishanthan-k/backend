GET -> api call/route on url
	-> changes in url on browser while hitting GET request
	
	
POST -> calling an api but that api is not the route
	 -> for example, 
	 -> opening chatgpt => chat.openai.com
	 -> creating an new chat => chat.openai.com/<random-code>
	 -> sending the prompt "what are the basic api calls on the backend" => chat.openai.com/<same-random-code>
	 	see the url/route doesn't get changed, it is the same chat url because the prompt was sent and handled at chat.openai.com/backend-api/conversation
